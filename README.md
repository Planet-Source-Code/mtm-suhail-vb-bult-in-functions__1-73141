## VB BULT\-IN FUNCTIONS


</div>

### Description

<b>Visual Basic provides more than 200 built-in statements and functions. Some are used frequently; some are seldom used at all. Even experienced programmers sometimes happen upon a statement or function they didn't know about.

This appendix can be considered a quick-reference guide to all of VB's built-in statements and functions. It offers the syntax for each, as well as a brief description of what it does and how its arguments (if any) are used. This is by no means a complete reference. Microsoft's Visual Basic 6.0 Language Reference is probably the best source for in-depth information on VB's statements and functions. If you have any questions about syntax or use of a particular statement or function, then you are strongly urged to consult that reference to obtain additional information.</b>
